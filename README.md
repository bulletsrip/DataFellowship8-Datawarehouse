# Practice Case Session 3: Data Warehouse
>From this public table `data-to-insights.ecommerce.rev_transactions`. Create an efficient query which
derives the total transactions per date and country based on the channel grouping! (Donâ€™t forget to
clean the data and bonus point if using repeated columns)

## Query
```sql
 SELECT 
  channelGrouping as channel,
  date,
  ARRAY_AGG(
    STRUCT(geoNetwork_country as country, totals_totalTransactionRevenue as transaction_amount)
  ) as c,
  SUM(totals_totalTransactionRevenue) as totalrevenue
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.rev_transactions`
GROUP BY date, channelGrouping
ORDER BY date DESC
```
